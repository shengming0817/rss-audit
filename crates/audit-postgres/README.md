# rss-audit-postgres

PostgreSQL 16+ Audit persistence. The host supplies a pool, monotonic timer,
absolute total and operation deadlines, cancellation and explicit `Integrity::Plain` or `Integrity::Ledger(auth)`.
No migration execution, pool shutdown, global reads, memory provider or automatic downgrade.
The `ledger` and `messaging` features are independently additive; `integration` is test-only.

## Ownership and retry

`PgAudit::prepare(event, control)` obtains `recorded_at` from PostgreSQL in V1 Unix seconds.
It returns `PreparedAuditV1`, not a write receipt. Preserve these exact canonical bytes durably
in the source's retry/outbox state before an append can become uncertain. Recreating an event
with a new recording time after commit-unknown is a different request and correctly conflicts.
`PreparedAuditV1::from_canonical_bytes` restores structurally valid bytes; it authenticates
neither their source nor the recording-time assertion. Source adapters remain trusted.

`append` returns canonical `LocalTxAttempt<Committed<StagedAppend>, Error>`. Only the private
`Committed` constructor follows an acknowledged database COMMIT. Successful staging, an error,
an absent read, `CommitUnknown` and `RollbackFailed` are not rollback evidence. Retry the
unchanged prepared request to serialize recovery. Database errors remain redacted. `Error::Storage { kind, source }` retains a closed
`StorageFailure::{Transient,Permanent}` classification; permissions/schema failures require
intervention, while connection interruption, contention and cancellation may be retried.
The messaging conversion preserves that classification; neither class grants ACK authority.

`read_tx_with_context(tenant, control, context, callback)` supplies `ReadAuditTransaction`
inside a PostgreSQL read-only transaction. It checks tenant scope before trusted reads,
never reserves Audit/Ledger heads, and exposes no append or lock operation.
`write_tx_with_context` supplies `WriteAuditTransaction` after acquiring the optional Ledger chain lock. It also provides the read methods. Pass `()` when no context is needed.
Both borrow trusted business SQL via `with_connection`. A callback returning `Result<R, E>` produces
`LocalTxAttempt<Committed<R>, TransactionError<E>>`: `Operation(E)` retains the original
host reason/classification, `Audit(Error)` identifies adapter/control failures, and
`Rollback { operation, settlement }` retains both causes when rollback is unconfirmed.
`E` needs no formatting or error trait; diagnostics never render or traverse it. Match it
explicitly to recover its typed value. `with_connection` likewise preserves its callback's
error type. There is no untyped business-rejection sentinel or error side channel.
Errors must propagate. This is not a SQL sandbox:
do not issue transaction control, change role/tenant/session state, or swallow append errors.
Plain takes no tenant-wide Audit lock. In Ledger mode acquire the chain before business/outbox locks.
`Control::new(timer, total_deadline, operation_deadline, cancel)` caps the operation cutoff
by the total cutoff without refreshing either. Acquisition, setup and settlement use total;
pre-locking and callback work use operation, allowing the host to reserve settlement time.
Server statement timeouts also bound outstanding work. Settlement drains pending server
responses before rollback and remains limited by the original total cutoff; it may still fail. `total_remaining` and `operation_remaining` expose each cutoff.
Unconfirmed connections are closed, never reused.
Cancellation after the callback returns an error cannot overwrite that error. If cancellation
prevents rollback from starting, the result is `RollbackFailed` with both causes, not
`CommitUnknown`: this branch never attempted commit. Only a real rollback ACK permits
`RolledBack`. No fresh cleanup budget is minted.
Preparation errors before COMMIT also use this rollback path. `CommitUnknown` requires
that this owner has actually started the COMMIT operation.

With `messaging`, `append_in(&mut PgTransaction, &prepared)` borrows the actual message connection,
inherits its tenant and remaining budget, and changes no GUC, isolation level or lifecycle state.
It does not use this Audit object's pool. Its result is staged; only the original message owner
can settle Inbox/business/Audit/ledger together and mint ACK authority. Return failures through
that owner; original `PgError` classification, including ownership loss, is preserved.

## Facts derived inside a transaction

`write_tx_with_context` acquires the fixed Audit chain only in Ledger mode, before the callback.
For a borrowed messaging transaction, `lock_head_in` similarly pre-locks only the selected chain.
Plain does not serialize callbacks or product receipts. The host owns their business concurrency.

After deriving final facts, use `WriteAuditTransaction::append_with(identity, resolver)` or
`PgAudit::append_with_in(tx, identity, resolver)`. The resolver is synchronous: it receives
`Option<&Record>` and database time, then returns an existing `PreparedAuditV1` or prepares
new bytes with `rss_audit_core::prepare`. The adapter validates identity and mode, stages the
Ledger and Audit entries, and returns `StagedAppend` with the exact persisted bytes.
No public reservation, permission cache or second transaction is introduced.

Resolvers require READ COMMITTED. In Ledger mode the chain lock protects the preceding lookup;
in Plain mode it is an ordinary lookup, not a reservation. The host must serialize any business
receipt decisions that require it. Resolver errors propagate unchanged; synchronous work stays
within the existing operation budget. A later append detects conflicting stable bytes.

Product receipt consistency remains product-owned: only a valid matching pair may restore
exact bytes. A missing or damaged side must fail, not trigger automatic repair. Save the returned
canonical bytes in the same transaction. After commit-unknown, serialize with the previous
transaction and restore committed materials; an unlocked absent read is not rollback evidence.
The exact `append`/`append_in` APIs remain for already-prepared durable retry/outbox requests.

## Integrity and reads

Stable identity is `(tenant, source_id, event_id)`. Exact bytes and stored integrity mode
must agree on replay. The host may choose another mode for a new event in the same tenant;
there is no permanent tenant-mode pin. Ledger failure aborts; it never retries plain.
HMAC, chain ordering and key admission remain owned by the optional in-workspace Ledger components.

`read_page(Cursor, ReadLimit, control)` uses stable navigation positions allocated by a database
sequence. Positions allow gaps and do not represent commit order or reliable consumer offsets.
Supply 1..=1024 rows and a positive canonical-byte budget. SQL checks the selected page's byte
budget before returning payloads; oversized pages return no partial rows.
The first statement fixes the maximum currently visible position. Continuations select
`after < position <= through` in position order. The upper bound does not freeze membership:
a low position committed after it was passed can require a fresh query to become visible.
Ordinary pagination does not authenticate missing rows. Ledger verified windows retain their
separate contiguous-chain checks. Product incremental projections must choose their own contract.

With `ledger`, `read_verified(tenant, Sequence, ledger::ReadLimit, control)` authenticates a window
and checks its Audit-row association. Its budget charges ledger encoded bytes, including the
predecessor. Ordinary cursors and ledger sequences are not interchangeable. Plain rows are not
in the ledger window. Verification does not prove source truth, complete Audit history, absence
of tail truncation or an external checkpoint.

## Installation and roles

`MIGRATION_SQL` installs the current schema (0001 plus 0002) in a single transaction.
For an existing 0001 installation, stop writers and execute `NAVIGATION_UPGRADE_SQL` once in a
transaction as its existing NOLOGIN NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS NOCREATEROLE migration owner.
It preserves canonical bytes, identities, existing positions and Ledger coordinates, starts the
sequence above the historical maximum, transfers writer grants, and removes Audit heads/reserve.
It does not change a product installation's integrity mode or rewrite Ledger authentication.
Upgrade optional Ledger functions separately using its `LOCKED_HEAD_UPGRADE_SQL` before admission.
Runtime must not own objects or reach the owner, have CREATE/delegation rights or PUBLIC access.
Grant only:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA rss_audit TO audit_runtime;
GRANT SELECT ON rss_audit.records TO audit_runtime;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION rss_audit.append_batch(uuid,text[],text[],bigint[],bytea[],bigint[])
    TO audit_runtime;
```

No runtime sequence privileges are required or permitted.

Runtime cannot INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE tables. Fixed SECURITY DEFINER functions enforce
tenant scope and append a physical batch. The records table FORCEs RLS, including for
its owner. Ledger and transactional-messaging installations/grants remain separately owned.
The host must configure authenticated TLS; Audit does not accept a URL or replace pool settings.
Admission checks actual role, inherited/switchable access, columns, constraints, RLS, definer
bodies/configuration, durability and privileges. Incompatible configuration fails startup validation. Privileged
operators can still alter storage; Audit provides no WORM, retention/hold, key custody or DR policy.

ref: sea-ql/sea-orm TransactionError<E>@2.0.2 (typed callback error, not settlement authority)

Tenant-bound operations check the actual tenant without repeating startup catalog validation. The
independent prepare operation only reads database time without binding a transaction tenant.
`Error::is_interrupted()` classifies Audit and Ledger deadline/cancellation causes consistently;
it does not prove rollback or authorize a retry.

## Installation and startup validation

`PgAudit::new` validates the actual Audit pool's role, schema, RLS, ACLs and functions.
Ledger mode validates Ledger storage on the same lease, including for a one-connection pool.
For a different borrowed runtime, call `validate_connection(connection, control)` or
`validate_in(message_transaction)` during startup using its **actual** credential/connection.
The latter inherits the original message owner's budget; neither method changes settings,
acquires a second connection, repairs permissions or owns settlement. Hosts must bound server
execution and retire unconfirmed connections after cancellation.

Database engines, controlled deployment roles and trusted host infrastructure are inside the
trust boundary. Stop and drain relevant writers before schema/role changes, validate the new
configuration, then resume. Failure keeps service closed. Ordinary operations do not inspect
catalogs or promise to detect arbitrary administrator GRANT/DDL before the next method call.
SQL permissions/RLS, tenant scope, canonical identity and data/Ledger integrity still apply.
Product authorization and revocation remain live at their separately defined business boundary.
This is not protection against a database controller or a WORM guarantee.

Read-only hosts use `PgAuditReader` with a separately provisioned credential that has SELECT but no Audit or Ledger append-function authority, including inherited/SET-role authority. It shares the full structural admission and existing bounded page/verified-window/read-transaction implementations, but exposes no append or writer handle. The host owns the pool, deadlines and re-admission after controlled changes.

## Borrow an existing SQLx transaction

`append_in_transaction(tx, prepared, control)` and `append_batch_in_transaction(tx, records, control)`
use the same Audit write kernel as owned transactions and the messaging adapter. Batch results
follow input order; repeated identical identities return the same record and only the first newly
inserted occurrence has `inserted=true`. Different bytes conflict. Empty input does no DB work.
Audit inserts and reads back sets, not a loop of complete single-record transactions. Optional
Ledger appends still perform their necessary chain-order work; no Ledger batch throughput is claimed.

The host admits the actual borrowed credential at startup, configures tenant and server timeouts,
and owns isolation, commit/rollback and connection quarantine. The adapter never acquires a second
connection or changes GUCs. Propagate any error and roll back the whole transaction. Under stronger
isolation, competing writes can cause serialization failure; only the host retries the transaction.
Prepare exact bytes with recorder-authoritative time before append and retain them after uncertainty.
